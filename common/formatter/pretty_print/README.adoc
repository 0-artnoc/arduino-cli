= Pretty Prints package
Alessandro Sanino <a.sanino@arduino.cc>

This package allows to print task results in a friendly way.

It is mostly designed for text mode, if other format is required to be printed (e.g. _JSON_) 
please refer to link:/cmd/output/README.adoc[Output package].

This package mostly consists of predefined task wrappers to print output of tasks in a more user
friendly way. 

See link:../../task/README.adoc[Tasks package] for more info.
