=== Missing vendored packages even if pushed correctly on GitHub
This issue is related to link:https://github.com/Masterminds/glide/issues/106[this one] and 
is about some folders being ignored since they are git repositories (and become submodules).

To solve this, simply force add the packages, the most simple way is:
[source, bash]
----
$ cd path/to/arduino-cli/repo
$ git add -f .                # Force adds every file, even if should be ignored.
$ git commit -m "Awesome message"
$ git push 
----
