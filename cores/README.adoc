= Cores (and Tools) package
Alessandro Sanino <a.sanno@arduino.cc>

This package allows to handle all cores and tools features for the CLI.

The `cores` is divided in 2 pseudo packages, one regarding tools and one regarding cores.

==== The cores download process
Cores are downloaded after their dependencies have been at least cached into the system.

Tools cannot be downloaded directly, they are downloaded if needed by a core.

Downloads are executed in parallel using `releases.ParallelDownload()` function.
